# Cellblock

Open world scene management in gdscript.

## Making an open world game?

Cellblock provides a simple and performant framework for developing open world games with a lot of
assets. Open world games have unique problems with scene management. As the player moves around the
world, content should seamlessly load and unload from the scene to keep framerate stable. There's no
reason to load assets into the scene tree if the player is nowhere near them. Building world assets
with Cellblock allows for real time loading and unloading of world content that is nearest to the
player.

There is also a central workflow problem to solve while developing your game. How do you build the
world content efficiently without slowing down the godot editor? The player only sees the content around
her, but how is this possible in the godot editor while developing? The solution is a data driven
approach, and easy-to-use editor tools. Cellblock allows devs to build their open world game as
efficiently as the player exploring it! I wanted to make a similar designing and editing experience to
those familiar with the TES Construction set. This more declaritive approach avoids some of the
complexity and difficulty of use in other open world management implementations I have seen in Godot
involving Octrees and custom Mesh types. It also is not dependent on a specific terrain system, but
can seamlessly be used with one (such as the fantastic Terrain3D addon).

## Cellblock's Design

Cellblock has taken design queues from classic Elder Scrolls games like Morrowind, and it's open
source engine OpenMW. A Cell is a small area containing game content. It can contain static art
assets like trees, rocks or castles - mutable objects such as items, doors or other scriptable
objects - and even characters! These Cells will be seamlessly streamed in and out of the world
according to various settings. Cellblock also sets you up to manage the saving and loading of all
this game state data as serializable JSON.

Only the Cells surrounding the player will be loaded, and there are many configurable options to
decide when, how and how many cells to load. Some games have large assets that are impractical to
keep in memory all the time, other games can load all the Cell data into RAM and only pop them in and
out of the tree. Both situations can be handled with this Addon. There are also customizable 
in-memory caching options.

Nearby Cells are chosen in a radius around a user-defined origin node.

## Installation

Follow normal godot 4.x addon installation procedures. Copy the project/addons/cellblock folder into
your projects addon folder. Enable the addon in your project's plugin settings, and restart the
engine.

This addon has only been tested with godot 4.4.x as of right now.

## Setup and Usage

First, you'll need to create a `CellAnchor` node in your game world, which is provided by the addon.
This node is the attachment point for the editor tools, and also the in-game data. Next you will need
to create one or more `CellRegistry` resources in the inspector. One may be fine for your needs, but
the addon supports multiple grids in case you want some cells to be loaded from farther away.

The `CellRegistry` contains most of the relevant setup variables. Lets go over the properties here.

- cells: This is a dictionary containing all of your `CellData`. More about `CellData` discussed
below.
- max_cache_size: An int controlling the max number of `Cell` scenes kept in the cache (if your 
chosen `LoadStrategy` is using the LRU cache).
- load_strategy: This enum controls the way your `Cells` will be loaded and kept in memory.
- grid_size: The size of the cell grid in your game world.
- cell_size: The size of the 'gap' between cells. Lower value means more cells in the grid, i.e a
value of 1 would mean 1 cell for every vertex in the grid.
cells.
- cell_directory: The directory where your `Cell` scenes will be saved.
- base_cell_scene_path: This is the base scene that you wish to be created when the editor tool
creates a new `Cell` to edit. It is defaulted to the the `Cell` node, but you may want to extend this
node and use that one instead.
- radius: the coordinate radius in which to load cells. This cooresponds to the how many loops of the
x, y, z axis will occur per frame, so it is bounded to max 3 to avoid too many loops.

Cellblock registers a singleton called `CellManager` that you need to hook into. Once you have
created a `CellRegistry`, somewhere you will need to start the `CellManager`. In this repo's demo
project, I put it in the World script itself like this:

```
class_name World
extends Node3D

@onready var player = $Player
@onready var cell_anchor = $CellAnchor

func _ready():
	# here is where you would create your cell save, or update it's filepath. 
	cell_anchor.cell_save.save_file_name = "user://savegame.save"
	CellManager.start(player, self, cell_anchor)
```

## Cell Creating and Editing Workflow

![alt text](https://github.com/liamhendricks/cellblock/blob/main/docs/setup1.png "Setup 1")

In the editor, when you click on your `CellAnchor` node, you'll notice some options in the bottom
right area of the editor, below the inspector window. This is how you will create, save and load the
cells you are editing. You'll notice X, Y and Z spinner buttons. When updating these coordinates, you
will see the `CellAnchor` node moving to that coordinate in world space. If you are using multiple 
cell registries, you will use the Registry Index spinner to select the registry to work on.

Click the 'Create Cell' button to create a new cell. This will create a new `Cell` scene, and a
cooresponding `CellData` resource file, which automatically gets added to your `CellRegistry`. You
are now free to edit the cell scene itself in the editor. When you are done editing, make sure you
click the 'Save Active' button to save the scene. This scene gets saved in your cell_directory that
was specified in the `CellRegistry`. Also, you will see the cell in the active cells panel.


If you want, you can also manually create the scene and manually add the `CellData` record to the
`CellRegistry.cells` dictionary. It's also possible to load scenes in the editor tool created this
way. Completely up to you.

You can also load a cell by choosing it from the dropdown. Only 1 cell can exist at a given coordinate
per registry. You can load and edit many cells at once, and save and clear them as you please.

## Building your Cells

The `Cell` node is designed to be extended (see the `CellRegistry` documentation above) to fit your
gameplay needs. The base class is a good starting point, but I would highly recommend extending the
class even if you don't need any new functionality right away. If you get halfway through building
your game and realize the `Cell` class provided by this addon is insufficient, it may be very
annoying to try to retroactively fix all your cells. There are some things I can do to enforce this
behavior, but I haven't done it yet.

An example of a reason you may want to extend `Cell`: you have doors in your game that have mutable
data (have they been opened, locked, etc), but they do not move. It makes sense to save this data
along with the other mutable objects, but you may not want to return them in the `Cell.get_mutable()`
function, because they do not move, and therefore it's not necessary to check if they need to be
reparented.

In the future I'll also consider making it possible to extend the `CellData` resource.

## Saving and Loading mutable CellData in game

The `CellSave` resource is available to developers to indicate the filepath for storing mutable cell
data records. This data is stored as serialized JSON, but feel free to extend the `CellSave` resource
and serialize it any way you like. Each `CellData` resource stores a Cell's mutable data in memory in
a dictionary until a save is initiated.

When a player saves your game, the `CellManager` needs to be told so that the cell data can be saved
as well. Here is the example in the `player.gd` script in this repo's demo project:

```
if Input.is_action_just_pressed("save"):
    // - update your cell_registry.cell_save resource with the game save filepath if necessary
    // - do any other saving / loading of other game state if you need
    // - call the CellManager.save_cells() method
    CellManager.save_cells()
    return
```

## More about Mutable objects

Mutable objects are automatically reparented to a new Cell if they get closer to a that cell. You have
control over which objects are affected by this reparenting behavior by which nodes are returned in
the `Cell`'s `get_mutable()` method. By default, all nodes that are children of the Objects or Characters
nodes will be returned by `get_mutable()`, and auto reparented to the closest node.

### Caviats and Known Issues

- 'Cell space' and 'world space' are decoupled from each other, so changing the grid_size and cell_size
properties will not mess up the positioning of your cells. However, changing these properties might
mean that your coordinates become 'invisible' to the grid. I.e, it is possible to create a large grid
of, say, 1000, 50, 1000. Then create a cell at a very high number. Then if you change the grid_size
to be lower than that cell vertex, it will be unreachable. Additionally, changing the size of the grid
or the size of cells drastically, may necessitate changing cells to belong in different coordinates.
Otherwise the world position of the cell would be too far from the cell coordinates and it could result
in cells getting loaded too soon, or not soon enough.

- As you are editing cells, the `Cell` scene gets added to the editor scene tree. If you save the scene 
and forget to press 'Clear Active'. That active `Cell` scene in the editor will be attached to the scene
in-game, which is likely not desired behavior. Make sure to 'Clear Active' after you are done editing
so this doesn't happen, until I can figure out a better way of dealing with this :/. In my personal
project that uses this addon, I have a function in my world.gd script that just removes all the nodes
that accidentally got saved, but surely there is a more graceful way of handling this.

- When you save a `Cell` scene using the editor tool, it saves the actual scene in the file system.
This means that if you have that scene open in another editor tab, it will override it and you will
lose progress in that tab. I think there is a way to inspect other editor tab scenes, so I think I
can fix this by just prompting the user to save and close that tab (like the engine editor does in
this kind of scenario) so this will likely get fixed in the future.

### Future Updates and Features

- Add visible grid to editor tool with mouse snapping.
- Gracefully handle editor cells that get saved during development.
- When updating grid_size or cell_size, calculate new coordinates for cells based on new nearest cell.
- Filtering / sorting active cell UI items.
